# staging beside the LINK and renaming over it replaces the link with a plain
# file, orphaning the repo so every later apply stops reaching Hyprland — and a
# stage file on another filesystem turns the rename into a non-atomic copy.
# Resolving first means the write lands on the real file, in its own directory,
# and the link survives. Target and directory must both be the user's and
# writable by nobody else.
